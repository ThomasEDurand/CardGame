# CardGame

<h1>Overview</h1>
This is a card game based on [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) that I made to get more comfortable using javaFX and the MVC design pattern.


<h1>Planned Features</h1>
<p>Clean up code, remove all prints to system output. All info will be in the display</p>
<p>Multiplayer support needs work. Right now right click adds the cards to player twos tray but I plan on adding keyboard controlls for p2. Additionally There will be a window to choose between singleplayer, two players, or vs a bot<p>
<p>Play vs comp. Just a simple opponent that will chose a set every 10 seconds or so. Nothing groundbreaking<p>
